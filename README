PluginRouting
=============

This plugin is a port of James Adam's RailsEngine routing extension[1].

It allows plugins to define their own routes in a familiar routes.rb file (see the example with this plugin).  Users of other such plugins can then add those plugin's routes in their application's routes at the appropriate location in config/routes.rb using:

  map.from_plugin(name_of_plugin)

If you are writing a plugin that defines its own routes, and you want them to be loaded using this mechanism, remember to have your plugin's install.rb write out a suitable message on the console explaining that the PluginRouting plugin should be installed too.
