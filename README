PluginRouting
=============

This plugin is a port of James Adam's RailsEngine routing extension[1].

It allows plugins loaded subsequently to define their own routes in a familiar routes.rb file (see the example with this plugin).  Users of the plugin can then add the plugin's routes in their application's routes at the appropriate location in config/routes.rb using:

  map.from_plugin(name_of_plugin)
